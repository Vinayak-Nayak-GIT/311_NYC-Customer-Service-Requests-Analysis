# NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis

![Project Image](link_to_project_image.png)

## Project Description

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of New York City's 311 service requests dataset. The goal was to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the 311 service system, including complaint types, response times, and geographical patterns. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and visualization to uncover meaningful findings.

## NYC 311 Overview

NYC 311's mission is to provide the public with quick and easy access to all New York City government services and information while offering the best customer service. Each day, NYC311 receives thousands of requests related to several hundred types of non-emergency services, including noise complaints, plumbing issues, and illegally parked cars. These requests are received by NYC311 and forwarded to the relevant agencies such as the police, buildings, or transportation. The agency responds to the request, addresses it, and then closes it.

## Key Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing data to ensure data quality.
- Explored and visualized the distribution of complaints across different cities and complaint types using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Conducted statistical tests to assess relationships between complaint types and cities, achieving high accuracy.
- Investigated response times and compared them across boroughs, providing actionable insights for resource allocation decisions.
- Presented the analysis results in a clear and informative manner through visualizations and concise summaries.
